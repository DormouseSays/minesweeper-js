# minesweeper-js
A simple javascript minesweeper clone, designed as an example to test a build process for frontend javascript applications. Intended to include unit testing and automated compression/minification, and show a clear separation of logic and display.

Planned work includes multiple testing frameworks and multiple visual examples of the game using the same underlying code.
